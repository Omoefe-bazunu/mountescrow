## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Navy Blue (#002B5C) evokes trust and security in financial transactions. This choice is taken directly from the prompt.
- Background color: Light gray (#F2F4F8), specified in the prompt. This color keeps the focus on content without distracting the user. A very desaturated shade of Navy Blue makes a good, very subtle background.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF6F00), directly from the prompt. This provides a vibrant contrast to the primary Navy Blue.
- Headers: 'Bebas Neue' (sans-serif) -- a clean modern sans-serif, is the font requested for titles. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Body: 'Montaga' (serif), to compliment 'Bebas Neue', will add an elegant literary and vintage style that is the font requested for the body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Crisp, professional icons representing financial transactions, security, and user roles.
- Subtle micro-interactions for button clicks and smooth transitions between sections to enhance user engagement. Following the prompt, these will have an Apple-level feel.
